* DONE implement stuck arrows into the ground
* DONE spawn slimes at some distance from the hero, preferrable in location without slimes
* DONE slimes should not intersect with player
* DONE make gameover screen
* DONE count scores
* DONE make old corpses of slimes dissapear
* DONE make arrows of finite amount + make collectable arrows
